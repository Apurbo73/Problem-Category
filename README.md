### Problem Category:

The program first reads the number of test cases, T. For each test case, it reads the integer x, which represents the problem’s point rating assigned by the admin. This value is then checked against the defined ranges to determine the problem’s difficulty category.

The code uses conditional statements to check where x falls: if x is between 1 and 99 (inclusive of 1, exclusive of 100), it prints "Easy"; if between 100 and 199, it prints "Medium"; and if between 200 and 300, it prints "Hard". The output matches the exact case required, and the process repeats for all test cases.
